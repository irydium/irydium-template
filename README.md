# Irydium template

This is an early start of a template project for Irydium documents.
To get started with it, run the following:

```
npx degit git@github.com:irydium/irydium-template.git my-notebook
npm install
```

At the moment you can do two things:

Preview your document (`index.md` in this folder):

```
npm run dev
```

Build your document into a static web page (`index.html`):

```
npm run build
```

More to come!
